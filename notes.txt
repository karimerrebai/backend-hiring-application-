1 to display all the companies we use the getallcompanies method in 
the backend and consume it in the front end  
2 than we display a company by its id to get all the information that we need 
then we simply can confirm the company or refuse and delete it  

3 if it its confirmed than it can acess and login in the website other wise it cant 
acecc to our web application .
4 to do that we have to add an attribute to our company called isConfirmed and by deafult 
should get false 
5 then when it register its own data the admin should get a notification that a company
has registred in our data base and if it is legall company the admin will consume 
a backend service and confirm the  company  !! 
6 the confirm method is to make the isConfirmed attribute true , 
and if its not confirmed then company will recieve a message tell them that your
are not confirmed thank you for your visiting

//filtring the offres if it is expired dont display it
